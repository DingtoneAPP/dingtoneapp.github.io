<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The<span class="privacy_policy_blue__26X0p"> dingtone.me </span>website (the Website or Dingtone Website) and Dingtone mobile
              applications (the Software or Dingtone Software) are owned and
              operated by Dingtone, Inc. (&quot;Dingtone&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;). Our Privacy
              Policy explains how we, and some of the companies we work with,
              collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our
              websites and Dingtone Software (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;).
            </p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>(1) Contacts Information</p>
<p>You need to allow Dingtone to access your address book on your mobile device. By authorizing the access you can easily send messages and make calls, forward messages and files, share contacts information, or initiate a conference call to your friends and family. A simplified copy of the address book with information such as the name, phone number, and ringtone of each contact will be stored and used to display the identity of the caller who&#x27;s in the user&#x27;s contact book(the caller will also be automatically added to the user&#x27;s Dingtone friend list) in the push notification. We create a cryptographic hash value of the transmitted information to prevent any misuse. The information will not be shared with any third parties and will be removed permanently once the user disables the app.</p>
<p>(2) Personal Information</p>
<p>When you install Dingtone Software on your mobile device, you are required to provide a mobile phone number to receive an access code via SMS. The phone number will be saved on the Dingtone servers. The phone number is also used to discover other Dingtone users who have your phone number in their address book.</p>
<p>When you create a Dingtone account, we may ask for personal information, like your name or email address. We may also collect demographic information, such as age, gender, or preferences. We might also ask you to create a publicly-visible profile, which may include your name and photo. These information might be used to provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing.If you register with a third-party account, we may collect the information such as age, gender, address or portrait from your third-party account and use it to complete your profile on Dingtone.</p>
<p>(3) Location Information</p>
<p>Certain Dingtone features require access to the location information on your mobile phone. Some features, such as &quot;Find Nearby Friends&quot; also store your location information in our servers, and share your location information with other Dingtone users. If you are concerned about the privacy of your location information, we recommend you do not use those features.</p>
<p>(4) Device Information</p>
<p>When you install Dingtone on your device, we may automatically collect certain information from your device, including an Android, Apple iOS, or other ID, device maker and model, mobile web browser type and version, IP address, MAC address, the operating system’s maker and version, location information, MCC (Mobile Country Code) information, the mobile application name and other technical data about your device and use them as identifying information to detect, investigate, prevent, or address technical issues or illegal activity.</p>
<p>A list of specific mobile applications installed on your device will also be collected to provide certain features, such as signing in from a third-party service or sharing messages on other third-party apps and services.</p>
<p>(5) Usage Information</p>
<p>We automatically collect usage information that does not identify an individual user. For example, when you install Dingtone on your device, we automatically collect information such as your device type, operating system version and type, IP address, certain unique device identifiers (such as Android ID, MAC address, and IDFA) and carrier and other information for your device. We use this information to enhance the services we offer and to help us understand how people use the Service.</p>
<p>(6) Analytic Information</p>
<p>We use third-party analytic tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, Dingtone software screens you access, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytic information with analytic information from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.</p>
<p>(7) Cookie and Tracking</p>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&#x27;s computer, and that the visitor&#x27;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Dingtone uses cookies to help Dingtone identify and track visitors, their usage of the Dingtone website, and their website access preferences. Dingtone visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Dingtone&#x27; websites, with the drawback that certain features of Dingtone&#x27;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<p>We use analytic tools provided by Google, AppsFlyer and others which use other visitor identification technology that help Dingtone identify users and track usage of our Service.</p>
<p>(8) Cache</p>
<p>When you use Dingtone to send a multimedia message (such as sharing a picture, or sharing a video clip), the multimedia content will be cached in Dingtone servers for enhancing the responding speed of our service and increasing the effectiveness of performance. The cached content will be removed after a certain period of months. Dingtone does not provide any means for you to delete the cached content manually.</p>
<p>(9) Share Data</p>
<p>Share Data is the data that you provide for use with Dingtone, such as text, audio, photos and videos you make available through the app or contacts you add or import for use with Dingtone, which might be used to ensure our services are working as intended and aid in more efficient delivery of our services, and also may be made available to third parties by your actions when using Dingtone.</p>
<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
<p>
              In addition to some of the specific uses of information we
              describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we
              receive to:
            </p>
<p>
             (1) Allow us to keep you posted on Dingtone&#x27;s latest product
              announcements, application updates, and upcoming events.
            </p>
<p>
             (2) Help us develop, deliver, test and improve our products, and
              services.
            </p>
<p>
             (3) Provide personalized content and information to you and others,
              which could include online ads or other forms of marketing.
            </p>
<p>
             (4) Provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our
              Service.
            </p>
<p>
             (5) Monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and
              demographic patterns.
            </p>
<p>(6) Diagnose or fix technology problems.</p>
<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>
              • We may share your information with businesses that are legally
              part of the same group of companies that Dingtone is part of, or
              that become part of that group (&quot;Affiliates&quot;). Affiliates may use
              this information to help provide, understand, and improve the
              Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates&#x27; own
              services (including by providing you with better and more relevant
              experiences).
            </p>
<p>
              • We also may share your information with third-party
              organizations that help us provide the Service to you (&quot;Service
              Providers&quot;). Our Service Providers will be given access to your
              information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service
              under reasonable confidentiality terms.
            </p>
<p>
              • We may also share certain information with third-party
              advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad
              networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements
              that they believe will be of most interest to you.
            </p>
<p>
              • We share the information we collect with third-party business
              partners who commit to comply with applicable laws concerning
              their usage of the information. Our third-party business partners
              may share anonymized information with their own third party
              business partners and use the information either for themselves or
              on behalf of their own business partners to operate and improve
              their services; provide you with advertisements and information
              for products and services in Dingtone Software or on other mobile
              apps or websites based on variables such as your location, and
              assess your level of engagement with them; and carry out other
              purposes that are disclosed to you and to which you consent.
            </p>
<p>
              • We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share
              anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your
              information with other information in a way that it is no longer
              associated with you and share that aggregated information.
            </p>
<p>
              • We may disclose your information to law enforcement,
              governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to
              a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when
              Dingtone believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
              necessary to protect the property or rights of Dingtone, third
              parties or the public at large.
            </p>
<h3>Link to Ads and Other Service</h3>
<p>
              The Service may contain services, products, and/or links to other
              services, products, and websites, that are not owned or controlled
              by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content
              nor for the privacy practices of these other websites, products,
              and services. We encourage you to be aware when you access a third
              party’s website or service and to read the privacy statements of
              each and every website and service you visit.
            </p>
<p>
              Some of our advertisers and/or advertising partners may display
              ads on Dingtone’s products or services that directly solicit
              information, or contain technology to collect information about
              our users. This information is collected and used by our
              advertisers and/or advertising partners, and is outside of our
              control. If you have any questions about a particular
              advertisement, you should contact the responsible advertiser
              directly.
            </p>

<h3>Children&#x27;s Personal Information</h3>
<p>
              All Dingtone services and websites are not intended for children
              under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 should not use
              them at any time. Dingtone does not knowingly collect any
              information from children under the age of 13. In the event that
              we learn that we have collected personal information from a child
              under age 13 without parental consent, Dingtone will promptly
              delete such personal information in a secure manner.
            </p>
<h3>Business Transfer</h3>
<p>
              If Dingtone, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or
              in the unlikely event that Dingtone goes out of business or enters
              bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that would
              be transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that
              such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Dingtone may
              continue to use your personal information as set forth in this
              policy.
            </p>
